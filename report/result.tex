\label{sec:result}

The speedup from when running the selected applications with the
different prefetchers is tabulated in \autoref{fig:initResults}.
% These speedups are calculated from stats from m5... Don't need this
% here, have already written this in methodology/intro - right?

    against program on the X-axis.}
\end{figure}

Detailed data of the results from the optimal parameter search as
described in \autoref{sec:methodology} is not included, being just an
intermediate step towards performing a just comparison of the
different prefetchers.

%What other results? Should we include parameter search results? What
%about results from experimenting with altering the prefetchers---does
%that belong here or in the discussion section?XS
