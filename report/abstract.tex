  In this paper, we investigate the relationship between different
  prefetching strategies and speedups in a suite of different programs
  from the SPEC CPU2000 benchmark. We do this by implementing and
  running the prefetching strategies using the M5 simulator. {\bf
    (references, citations)?}  We do not yet know what we discover!
