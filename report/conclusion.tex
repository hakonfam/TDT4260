\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we compared a number of prefetching algorithms run on
several different applications in order to compare to what degree they
sped up program execution on average. We also investigated whether
there was any difference with regards to which applications the
different prefetchers performed well on, or if there was a strategy
which clearly excelled. 

Maybe:
- One generally better, but not on some tasks
- Unable to modify it to be better
- For some (HPC) specific tasks, might be worth a specific prefetcher


Need actual data to arrive at any conclusion,
though!
