\paragraph{Variability of Prefetcher Performance}
\label{par:varprefperf}

%- Introduction?


%Should the data in here be in result instead? Percentages etc.
From these results, there are a number of interesting observations one
might make. The first item of interest relates to the average
prefetcher speedups. As one might expect, it is the most complex,
general purpose prefetcher, namely the GHB/PCDC prefetcher, which
yields the highest average speedup. With an average speedup of $1.54$,
it outperforms ABSP by $54.3\%$, SMS by $500\%$ and Markov by
$some\%$. As it attempts to improve upon weaknesses in earlier methods
as the ABSP and Markov prefetchers~\cite{Nesbit}, this .,

our results show that it is successful in
its quest. 

  can be taken as a testament to its success.


 We can therethe potential of recognizing more exotic
access patterns and integrating them into prefetch strategies which ,
but still


The more complex prefetchers perform better on average. Specifically,
the GHB prefetcher has the highest performance. However, the
difference is not very large except for a few benchmarks. These
exceptions are most likely occuring because the benchmark programs
have a memory access pattern which corresponds well with the
prefetcher which excels.
Blowup ideas:
       - Define complex - LoC table. Also, SMS is most complex, but worst?
       - GHB highest by how much? Specify the avg values, hard to read on the graph.
       - Aren't the differences very large? Specify percentages to justify such a claim
       - The last sentence needs clarification

%For instance, on the benchmark ammp the GHB prefetcher is able to
%achieve many times the speedup of the other prefetchers. This program
%operates on the 

 Explanation of ammp: refer to GHB paper stating that this has the
 highest potential for speedup? Perhaps the paper also states the
 memory access pattern in ammp?

One benchmark on which the GHB prefetcher was outperformed was the
galgel benchmark, on which the stride prefetcher got an average
speedup almost five times as high.

An interesting remark is that even though the ABSP is a simplication
of the prefetcher that GHB is an extension of, it has similar
performance gains on several of the benchmark programs.

SMS Prefetcher is not performing too well on our benchmark
programs. This is natural.
