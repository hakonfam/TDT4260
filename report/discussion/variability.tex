%- Introduction?


%Should the data in here be in result instead? Percentages etc.
From these results, there are a number of interesting observations. The first item of interest relates to the average
prefetcher speedups. As one might expect, it is the most complex,
general purpose prefetcher, namely the GHB/PCDC prefetcher, which
yields the highest average speedup. With an average speedup of
$1.054$, it outperforms ABSP by $54.3\%$, SMS by $500\%$ and Markov by
$some\%$. As it attempts to improve upon weaknesses in earlier methods
(such as the stride directed and Markov prefetchers~\cite{Nesbit}),
our results can be taken as an indication of its success. It therefore
shows that there may be merit in creating a prefetcher which handles
nontrivial memory access patterns, which, although not particularly
surprising, is nevertheless reassuring for the computer scientist
community.% TODO: Remove GPP?

A second point of interest is the relatively poor performance of the
SMS prefetcher. Although it is one of the more complex of the four
prefetcher implementations, it yields an average speedup which is only
$25\%$ of our simplest prefetcher, the ABSP. This is explainable by
the nature of the benchmark programs we ran the prefetchers with. As
explained in \autoref{sec:smsPrefetcher}, the SMS prefethcer is
designed to increase the performance of applications such as operating
systems and databases. However in the SPEC CPU2000 suite, there are no applications which has a memory pattern of high spatial locality~\cite{SPECFAQ}. As the programs exhibit a lower degree
of the memory access patterns the SMS prefetcher attempts to
recognize, it will be unable to be of much use. As can be seen in
\autoref{tab:numPrefetches}, the prefetcher is not completely
inactive, and is able to recognize some patterns. However, its
activity level is in general lower than the other prefetchers'. Thus,
using the SMS prefetcher in a domain it was not designed for is not
very beneficial. In addition, according to~\cite{SMS} the optimal
configuration has a memory usage requirement on the order of hundreds
of kilobytes, which was outside our parameter search space. This could
also account for some of the poor performance.

When studying the cause of the superior performance of the GHB
prefetcher in further detail, it is evident that one benchmark in
particular, namely \emph{ammp}, makes this prefetcher pull ahead of the other
algorithms. The geometric mean of the speedups when disregarding \emph{ammp}
is $1.045$, whereas the ABSP prefetcher, for instance, rises to
$1.039$, reducing the difference in performance
considerably. According to table 2 in \cite{Nesbit}, \emph{ammp} is the
application which has the greatest potential for speedup from
prefetching data, with the possibility of $815\%$ improvement in
execution time. Thus, being able to leverage this potential gives a
significant competitive edge. This also shows that using a prefetcher that can match several access patterns will have a larger chance of matching the access patterns of the applications, and that this can be significant for the average performance of the prefetcher. In contrast to the SMS prefetcher, the performance is still good even when disregarding the best input case. This is a consequence of its generic nature, attempting to match both normal and more rare access patterns.   

An interesting remark is that even though the ABSP is a simplication
of the prefetcher that GHB is an extension of, it has similar
performance gains on several of the benchmark programs. As previously notet, when disregarding the \emph{ammp} benchmark, its results is only $13.6\%$ worse than that of GHB. Considering the relative simplicity and low memory requirements of the ABSP prefetcher this difference might be too small to justify the choice of a prefetcher as complex as the GHB. This shows the value of investigating the context in which the prefetcher will be used.  

To be specific, one factor that is not taken into consideration is that the ABSP and markov prefetcher most likely would occupy less critical CPU surface, as they would not require having access to the program counter. The two prefetchers relying on the program counter (SMS and GHB) would need to be implemented close enough to the CPU to have access to the program counter, or would need to have the program counter passed on to them. Both of these solutions are likely to have a negative impact on the performance of the prefetchers.
