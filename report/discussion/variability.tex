\paragraph{Variability of Prefetcher Performance}
\label{par:varprefperf}

The more complex prefetchers perform better on average. Specifically, the GHB
prefetcher has the highest performance. However, the difference is not
very large except for a few benchmarks. These exceptions are most
likely occuring because the benchmark programs have a memory access pattern
which corresponds well with the prefetcher which excells.

%For instance, on the benchmark ammp the GHB prefetcher is able to
%achieve many times the speedup of the other prefetchers. This program
%operates on the 

One benchmark on which the GHB prefetcher was outperformed was the
galgel benchmark, on which the stride prefetcher got an average
speedup almost five times as high.
