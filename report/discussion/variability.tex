\paragraph{Variability of Prefetcher Performance}
\label{par:varprefperf}

The more complex prefetchers perform better on average. Specifically, the GHB
prefetcher has the highest performance. However, the difference is not
very large except for a few benchmarks. These exceptions are most
likely occuring because the benchmark programs have a memory access pattern
which corresponds well with the prefetcher which excells.

%For instance, on the benchmark ammp the GHB prefetcher is able to
%achieve many times the speedup of the other prefetchers. This program
%operates on the 

One benchmark on which the GHB prefetcher was outperformed was the
galgel benchmark, on which the stride prefetcher got an average
speedup almost five times as high. 

An interesting remark is that even though the ABSP is a simplication of the prefetcher that GHB is an extension of, it has similar performance gains on several of the benchmark programs.
