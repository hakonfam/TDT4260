\section{Discussion} % (fold)
\label{sec:discussion}


%Can only be written when results are present.
%Things to consider:
\input{./discussion/variability}
\input{./discussion/combining}
\input{./discussion/uncertainties}
% Also, perhaps state that a discovery we did was that tuning the
% prefetchers was very hard, since the results for a given benchmark
% did not follow a nice, quadratic function, but could vary wildly
% between different configurations (most likely due to program and
% problem instance specific attributes, causing a table size of 373 to
% be just large enough to include some faulty data).
