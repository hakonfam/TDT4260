\paragraph{Uncertainties}
\label{"waiting for reftex-label call..."}
The four prefetchers discussed in this report varies widely in complexity. One factor that is not considered when using the simulation environment is the time required by the prefetchers to perform its calculations. 

- Considering how the time spent by our prefetching algorithms is not
taken into account, are our results at all accurate and usable?

- Are our implementations perhaps not correct?
- Simulation environment misunderstandings?

- Anything else?
