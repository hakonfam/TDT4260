The four prefetchers discussed in this report varies widely in
complexity. One factor that is not considered when using the
simulation environment is the time required by the prefetchers to
perform its calculations. When performing tests using the M5
simulation environment the compute time used by the prefetchers is not
reported or taken into consideration when calculating the resulting
speedups. As such, complex prefetchers will not be punished for their
higher computational demands, and one has to keep this in mind when
considering the results.

One can not use these results to draw conclusions as to which of these prefetchers would yield the highest performance gain when being implemented in hardware. The reason for this being that the characteristics of a software prototype not necessarily corresponds to those of a hardware implementation of the same functionality.

As always with software, there is the possibility that the code
contains logical errors. These potential errors could have noticable
implications on the results of the prefethers.
