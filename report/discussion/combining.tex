\paragraph{Combining Prefetchers}
\label{par:prefcombo}
Since the prefetchers have somewhat varying performance on the
different programs, it might be a good idea to attempt to combine
them. This could be done in two ways. One way would be to try and
merge the two algorithms into a single prefetching algorithm. Another
way would be to create a controlling unit utilizing heuristics to
choose which of the two prefetchers should be used at a given time.

The first such strategy is especially applicable to the stride and GHB
prefetchers. The GHB is in essence almost a stride prefetcher, since a
constant delta stride will also be recognized. However, as there would
only be two more items left in the delta table after the point of
matching, only two addresses will be prefetched. According to
\autoref{tab:stridesettings}, this is most likely fewer addresses than
would be optimal. Therefore, one could try to recognize this special
case by checking when the final four elements of the delta table are
identical, and prefetch a larger set of blocks the constant stride
apart. The results from running the GHB prefetcher with this change
included is shown in \autoref{tab:ghbstridetab}.
