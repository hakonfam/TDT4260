\section{Status group 2}
As of today, we have three prefetchers working separatly. The plan is to get four prefetchers working, and use some sort of heuristic to choose which of them to use.

The three prefetchers that runs have some bugs, and are still work in progress, but they have all given a 1-2\% performance boost.

We have currently assigned one group member to each of the prefetchers. As soon as the preftcher being worked on is done, the person working on that prefetcher will start implementing the logicneeded to choose between the different prefetchers.
