\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}



To discover what the effect of using different prefetching strategies
for different applications are, we used the M5 simulator. This
simulator is a software implementation of the AlphaXXX processor
(reference)(should M5 description be in introduction?). By
implementing the different prefetching strategies we were considering
and building them into the simulator, we could run programs with this
simulator and get running time statistics for each of the
programs. Doing this for all the strategies gave us numbers for each
of them. Results could then be obtained by comparing these with the
running times of the applications when using no prefetcher. (Should we
say that they tests were run on a cluster?)
