\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}

To discover what the effect of using different prefetching strategies
for different applications are, we used a modified version of the M5
simulator, version 2.0\cite{M5} as a testing platform. This simulator
is a software implementation loosely based on the Alpha 21264
processor\cite{Alpha}. The version used was provided by the course
staff, and included an interface to the L2 cache prefetching
functionality of the simulator. By using this interface, we could
integrate our prefetchers into the processor simulator, such that the
resulting binaries would be a simulator of the processor with a
specific prefetcher algorithm in control of prefetching for the L2 cache.

For each of the simulators built this way, we executed a suite of
programs from the SPEC CPU2000 benchmark. The programs used are listed
in table~\ref{tab:benchmarks}. The simulator software automatically
tracked key statistics during the program execution, such as cache
misses, prefetches issued, and clock cycles used for running the
program. By comparing the number of cycles used when executing the
program with our prefetchers included in the simulator to the number
of cycles used without a prefetcher, we could calculate the speedup
gains due to the prefetcher for the different programs.

% Give prefetcher configurations
When implementing our prefetchers, there were a number of
implementation parameters which had to be set (e.g. the size of the
data structures used in the algorithm, the number of addresses to
prefetch). To get fair comparisons between the different strategies,
we wanted to find the settings which yielded the best results for each
prefetcher. To make the prefetchers more realistic, we were only
allowed to use 8 KiB of storage internally in our prefetcher. This set
the bounds for our prefetcher configuration space. 

Our strategy for
finding the optimal settings for the given prefetcher was to set them
initially to more or less arbitrary values within the permissible
range, and attempt to locate at least a local maximum by
varying the parameters in turn. Due to the enormous possible set of
values, only a few were tried for each degree of freedom---these are
listed in \autoref{tab:stridesettings}, \autoref{tab:ghbsettings},
\autoref{tab:smssettings} and \autoref{tab:markovsettings}. The
combination of parameters which yielded the highest average speedup
are marked in bold.
