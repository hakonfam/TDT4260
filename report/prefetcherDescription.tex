\section{Prefetcher Description}
\label{sec:prefetcherDescription}

In our paper, we will consider four different prefetching strategies,
each taken from a separate category of prefetchers identified in
Grannas' paper (reference needed).

\subsection{Sequential Prefetcher}

\subsection{Global History Buffer Prefetcher}
\label{sec:ghbPcdcPrefetcher}
The global history buffer prefetcher is an instruction based
prefetching scheme... We implement a variety called GHB/PCDC (Global
History Buffer, Program Counter based with Delta Correlation).
