\section{Prefetcher Description}
\label{sec:prefetcherDescription}

In our paper, we will consider four different prefetching strategies,
each taken from a separate category of prefetchers identified in
Grannas' paper (reference needed). The first two prefetchers are address based, and does not need any information about the program counter. The latter two prefetchers both needs to know the program counter.
