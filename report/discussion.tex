Can only be written when results are present.
Things to consider:

- How well do the different prefetchers perform on average?

- Are there any variance as to which programs they yield good speedup
on?

- How would combining them work?

- Considering how the time spent by our prefetching algorithms is not
taken into account, are our results at all accurate and usable?

- Anything else?
