\subsection{Problems}
During this assignment we mostly just encountered minor coding problems. The only thing worth mentioning is the issue we had with getting the data out from the data memory at the right time. When we ran the first simulations, the time it took from asserting the dmem\_write\_enable signal to when the data was available in the Write-Back stage, was two cycles instead of one. For specifics and solution see section \ref{sub:reading_from_data_and_instruction_memory}.

\subsection{The assignment}
This assignment was much simpler then the previous one, the major reason for this being that we were familiar with the tools. This gave us a better starting point and helped to increase efficiency within the group. It was also easier since most of the code could be reused with some adjustments.
