\subsection{Global History Buffer Prefetcher}
\label{sec:ghbPcdcPrefetcher}

The global history buffer prefetcher is an instruction based
prefetching scheme. In this scheme, a datastrcture called Global
History Buffer (abbreviated GHB) is maintained. This datastructure is
a table whose elements are addresses for which a cache miss has
recently occurred, as well as a pointer to the previous table element
representing a miss corresponding to the same program counter as the
given miss. A linked list of misses for a given ... We implement a
variety called GHB/PCDC (Global History Buffer, Program Counter based
with Delta Correlation).  {\bf (references, citations)}
